Project Overview
The To-Do List App is designed to help users manage their daily tasks with simplicity and style. Users can add, edit, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The app also persists data using Local Storage, ensuring tasks remain accessible even after refreshing the page. This project is ideal for practicing core front-end development concepts, including JavaScript DOM manipulation and CSS styling.

Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking a checkbox.
Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so they persist across sessions.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
